i have suggeste to return only the name and the idx in order to later use this index to calculte the macros of the input from the use like this :

the llm writh the LIKE qoery and than the tool excute the qoery and return the name and the idx of the food items that match the qoery.

then the llm will use this name to decide which one is the most relevant to use in the calculation of the macros of the input from the user.

then it will pass the amounts from the user input and the idx to a function tool that wil calculate the macros .

then we will have to plan the next steps to save this food item in the database of the user, but this is for later conversition.

im suggsting this approch in order to minamize usage of the llm so the response will be faster and cheaper and more relaibale . 

and all the llm have to do is to select the corect name from the given option.

give me your honest professional opinion about this approch.
