# docs: sync PRD and main_rule with response node completion

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Branch**: `respone-node-logic`
**Commit**: `7ca2b4b`

## Summary
Executed the `/sync_context` workflow to ensure project documentation accurately reflects the recent completion of the `response_node`.

## Changes Implemented
- **`PRD.md`**:
  - Added `response_node.py` and other new nodes to the `Directory Structure` tree.
  - Marked the implementation of the Response Node as completed (`✅`) under Phase 1.
  - Formally marked **Core LangGraph Flow Complete (MVP Phase 1 Done)**.
- **`.agent/rules/main_rule.md`**:
  - Updated the `Project Structure` tree to include `response_node.py`.
  - Removed outdated `(New)` tag from `stats_node.py`.

## Next Steps
The documentation is now fully in sync with the project. The next logical step is to open a PR for `respone-node-logic` and potentially start Phase 2 (Knowledge Integration).
