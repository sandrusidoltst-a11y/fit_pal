**Commit:** `chore: fixes file structure and typos`

## Changes Implemented

### 1. File Structure Cleanup
- **Fixed Typos**: Removed `noetbooks/` directory (typo for `notebooks`).
- **Standardization**: Moved `evaluate_lookup.ipynb` from root to `notebooks/` directory to align with project structure defined in `main_rule.md`.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removed the duplicate/stale notebook that was in the typo directory.
